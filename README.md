# Heart Attack Prediction System

The Heart Attack Prediction System is a cutting-edge application designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack for individuals based on their health metrics. 
Leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, this system provides users with proactive healthcare insights, potentially saving lives through early detection.

## Features

- **MERN Stack**: Utilizes MongoDB for efficient data management, Express.js for backend development, React for the frontend user interface, and Node.js for server-side scripting.
- **Machine Learning Capabilities**: Integrates Flask with scikit-learn to train a logistic regression model on a dataset of 1300 individuals, enabling accurate predictions of heart attack risk.
- **Sleek User Interface**: Developed an intuitive and modern user interface using React, allowing users to input their health metrics and view prediction results seamlessly.
- **Proactive Healthcare Insights**: Aims to provide users with proactive insights into their cardiovascular health, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing heart attacks.
